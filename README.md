# macropad (to be made using pi-pico microcontroller) (wip)
making (or at least attempting to make) as part of hackclub's #bin hardware electronics project <br>
made with <b>micropython</b> and uploaded to #bin for review for getting the physical parts shipped to me <br>
demo simulation can be <a href="https://wokwi.com/projects/406808444072711169">found here on wokwi</a> (but it might break) <br><br>

i personally think this can be HEAVILY improved if i use arduino but i'm working with what we have (and asking for extra buttons lol)

schematic can be found below <br>
